# hello-world

Hello world!

My name is John and I am new to coding but taking advantage of the COVID-19 quarantine here in NYC metro area by working through the IBM Data Science Certification on Coursera. I'm already fascinated by all the amazing analysis and problem solving that you can do with "big data." 

I'm sharing my coding journey and building my presence on github. You'll get to see my progress from my very first lines of code through to my more challenging projects and personal explorations.

Thanks for your interestâ€” stay tuned! Your comments and feedback are welcome!
